<br><br>Who knew these Roblox moderators were cracking down on so many cyberbullying cases!?! Roblox bans around 20,000 users daily, ranging from a plethora of reasons. From trivial problems like lying about your age all the way to pressing offenses like cyberbullying. But what is cyberbullying and why are we even trying to fix this “problem”? 

<br><br>You know bullying? Yeah... cyberbullying is just the online version, duh. Cyberbullying is a relatively general term that refers to anything offensive posted online that is meant to harm someone else. This can go from hurtful messages sent to specific people to photos and videos posted to embarrass others. Here and now, we resolve ourselves to condemn cyberbullying in all its forms. Whether it is from making offensive memes about the president to harassing little children, leading them to rage quit and tell their mommies. So, what can we do to prevent little kids’ childhood from being ruined?  <br><br>

<br><br>Listen up people, here comes the most effective solutions for cyberbullying. Lucky for you all, we have solutions for everyone, both the bullies and the bullied.  

<br><br>For the Bullies— 

<br><br>Bully people in person — Is it really necessary to bully others in two different ways? If they do the same thing and have the same effects, why put more effort? Just go back to the old-school way and focus on bullying people to their face. Why would you need to hide behind an online facade, when you can assert your superiority, not only in front of them, but also everyone else in the proximity.  

<br><br>For Victims— 

<br><br>The most obvious and simplistic solution to protect yourself from the dangers of cyberbullies is to stop subjecting yourself to these processes, get off the internet completely, and make no contact with people. No biggie. Self-isolation, truly a spectacular idea. How could anyone bully you, if they don’t even know who you are? When you are hidden, no one knows your insecurities, your weird habits, or anything about you, so, that means you're automatically safe from any type of bullying that may come your way. Such an easy solution to a relatively large problem. With everyone who is scared of being bullied, collectively isolating themselves, it would most definitely solve the worldwide problem of cyberbullying! 

<br><br>But sure, I get it! Self-Isolation could get a little lonely and boring. NOT TO WORRY, do we have another solution for you. <br><br>

        <iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwARSZEPie8?autoplay=1&mute=1;controls=0&amp;start=56" 
          title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; 
          web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
          
        </iframe>

<br><br>Just completely get rid of the heart of the problem. Cyberbullying is defined as bullying online, right? So, to get rid of it, all you have to do is get rid of the internet. Boom! All the cyberbullying removed in an instant. No longer a problem that has to be worried over! 

<br><br>So as a recap, cyberbullying can be fixed in a few simple and easy solutions. All of which require little effort, which only makes more of an incentive to utilize these solutions. With such simple solutions, it only makes it easier to reach this world without cyberbullying. So, remember, to eliminate cyberbullying, there are only a few collective things we have to do to achieve this state. The three simple solutions are all that have to be remembered: resort to bullying in person, self-isolation, and destroying the internet. With these three manageable keys to the elimination of cyberbullying, our world could work towards a state where there is no longer any cyberbullying that will haunt anyone.
